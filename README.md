# Getting Started with Klaytn Watch

[Klaytn Watch](https://klaytnwatch.netlify.app/) is a DeFi dashboard that allows users to search their address and view their token holdings and balance, also available is the ability for users to view their NFT holdings and their balance(s) and price if available.

**NOTE:**

All data displayed are gotten from [Covalent](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/) which provides industry-leading Unified API that brings visibility to billions of Web3 data points and they have different EndPoints provided.

Used in this project is a newly featured endPoint to get token balances for an address and its available in [Covalent Class A Endpoint](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/#/0/Get%20token%20balances%20for%20address/USD/1).

## How to use Klaytn Watch

Paste your 0x.. Address in the Search Bar on the [home page](https://klaytnwatch.netlify.app/), then press Enter or click the search button to Search and your account details will be displayed.

## Exciting feature

We had users in mind when building this project so using the Progressive Web App (PWA) feature available on the browser, users can now install Klaytn Watch on their devices as a standalone application and there will be no need to navigate to the browser everytime to use Klaytn Watch.

### How to install on Mobile

Automatically when you visit Klaytn Watch on your mobile device you should see a pop up at the bottom of your screen asking you to add Klaytn Watch to your Home Screen. If this is not the case you can navigate to the three dots at the top right of your browser, when you click it you will see Install, click on Install to download Klaytn watch as an application on your device.

### How to install on Desktop

If you are on Klaytn's Watch home page, at the far right in your search bar, you will see an icon indicating for you to install it on your desktop, click on the icon and Klaytn Watch will be available on your Desktop for use.

## What is the future of Klaytn Watch?

In the coming months more features will be added as we do more research on the [Covalent API](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/), and also we will be adding more aesthetics to give users a feeling as though they were using a Native application.

We consider working on a new version of the [Klaytn Watch](https://klaytnwatch.netlify.app/) after the Hackathon, where we will add more useful features that can help users to better have a good view of the Klaytn blockchain.
